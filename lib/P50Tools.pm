=item string_list

Here you can defined which list of string you will use, default or new list.

=item scan

This is a essential declaration, because here will start search.

=item output

Here you set the output file name.

=head1 P50Tools::LFIScan

This tool can find a LFI vulnerability in a site.

=item target

Here you defined target to search Local File Inclusion fail.

=item string_list

Here you can defined which list of string you will use, default or new list.

This is a essential declaration, because here will start search.

=item output

Here you set the output file name.

=head1 P50Tools::RFIScan

This tool can find a RFI vulnerability in a site.

=item target

Here you defined target to search Remote File Inclusion fail.

=item string_list

Here you can defined which list of string you will use, default or new list.

=item php_shell

Here you can defined the page with php shell code to incusion.

=item response

=item scan

This is a essential declaration, because here will start search.

=item output

Here you set the output file name.

=head1 P50Tools::SQLiScan

This tool can find a SQLi vulnerability in a site.

=item target_list

Is usual serarch SQLi fail in a list of pages extracted of a server. 
Here you set the file with the list.

=item output

Here you set the output file name.

=item scan

This is a essential declaration, because here will start search.

=head1 P50Tools::RandonDoors

This tool can be use to find a open doors in a target.

=item target

Here you defined target to search doors.

=item ini

Here you can defined initial door to start scan or use default "1".
